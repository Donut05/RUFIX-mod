<p>Here you can select between 8 textures to paint on the terrain ground.</p>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that these textures are in numbered layers.</p>
<p>So the bottom texture in the list will always end up under the textures above.</p>
<p>The tile builder is designed to only be able to have 3 textures painted on</p>
<p>each other, excluding the base grass texture. More textures than 3 in the</p>
<p>same place will create artifacts. This restriction is due to optimization.</p>
